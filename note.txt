Next js folder structure explanation:


1. package.json: This file contains your project's metadata and dependencies.

2. node_modules: This is where your project's dependencies are stored. You don't need to manage this folder manually; it's usually created and managed by your package manager.

3. public: This folder is used to serve static assets, like images, fonts, and other files that don't require server-side processing. Any file placed here can be accessed directly from the root of your application.

4. pages: This is a crucial folder in a Next.js project. Each file inside this folder corresponds to a route in your application.

5. .next: This folder is automatically generated by Next.js. It contains build-related files, cache, and other generated artifacts.

6. next.config.js: This optional file allows you to customize the Next.js configuration. You can set up plugins, configure custom webpack behavior, and more.

7. src: There are pages, layouts pages.

8. README.md: We can add note about our codes here.
